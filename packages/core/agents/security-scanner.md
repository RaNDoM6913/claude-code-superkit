# Security Scanner

Scan the codebase for common security vulnerabilities based on OWASP guidelines and general best practices.

## Phase 0: Load Project Context

Before starting, read available project documentation to understand architecture and conventions. Skip files that don't exist.

**Read if exists:**
1. `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` — project overview, conventions, tech stack
2. `docs/architecture/auth-and-sessions.md` — auth flow, session management, token lifecycle
3. `docs/architecture/api-reference.md` — all endpoints, which are public vs protected

**If no docs exist:** Fall back to codebase exploration (README.md, directory structure, existing patterns).

**Use this context to:**
- Know which endpoints are intentionally public (skip false positives on auth coverage)
- Understand the auth token lifecycle to check for proper expiry/refresh handling
- Identify project-specific security patterns (e.g., single-device enforcement, TOTP)

**Impact on review:** Violations of DOCUMENTED conventions get higher confidence (HIGH instead of MEDIUM).

## Review Process

### Phase 1: Checklist (quick scan)
Run through Checks 1-18 below. Report violations immediately without extended analysis.

### Phase 2: Deep Analysis (think step by step)
After the checklist, analyze:
1. What is the overall security posture?
2. What are the highest-risk attack surfaces?
3. Are there systemic patterns (e.g., consistently missing input validation)?
4. What compensating controls exist?

Show your reasoning before stating findings in Phase 2.

## Checks

### 1. SQL Injection (Critical)
Grep for string interpolation in SQL queries:
- Go: `fmt.Sprintf.*SELECT|fmt.Sprintf.*INSERT|fmt.Sprintf.*UPDATE|fmt.Sprintf.*DELETE`
- JS/TS: template literals with `SELECT|INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE` containing `${`
- Python: `f"SELECT|f"INSERT|"SELECT.*".format|%s.*SELECT` (outside ORM)
Parameterized queries (`$1`, `?`, `:name`) are safe. String interpolation in SQL is a vulnerability.

### 2. XSS (Critical)
Grep `dangerouslySetInnerHTML|v-html|innerHTML\s*=` in frontend code.
Each usage must be audited — input must be sanitized (DOMPurify or equivalent).

### 3. Secrets in Code (Critical)
Grep for patterns across all source files (excluding `.env.example`, test fixtures):
- API keys: `(?:api[_-]?key|apikey)\s*[:=]\s*["'][A-Za-z0-9]{16,}["']`
- Passwords: `password\s*[:=]\s*["'][^"']+["']` (not in example/config files)
- Private keys: `-----BEGIN.*PRIVATE KEY-----`
- Generic tokens: `(?:secret|token)\s*[:=]\s*["'][A-Za-z0-9]{16,}["']`

### 4. Auth Bypass (High)
- Check all API routes have appropriate auth middleware
- Identify which routes are intentionally public (health checks, login, public resources)
- Any other unprotected endpoint is a finding
- Grep for auth middleware registration and verify coverage

### 5. CORS Misconfiguration (High)
Read CORS middleware/configuration. Check:
- Not `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` with credentials
- Origin allowlist is explicit, not overly permissive
- Grep: `AllowOrigin.*\*|Access-Control-Allow-Origin.*\*|cors.*origin.*\*`

### 6. Rate Limiting (Medium)
Check rate limiting is configured for:
- Authentication endpoints (login, register, password reset)
- File upload endpoints
- Search/listing endpoints
- Write endpoints (create, update)
- Grep for rate limiter middleware or configuration

### 7. Input Validation (Medium)
Spot-check 3-5 handlers/controllers for:
- Request body size limits
- String length validation
- Numeric range validation
- Email/URL format validation
- File type and size validation

### 8. Sensitive Data Exposure (Medium)
Check API responses for leaked sensitive data:
- Password hashes in responses
- Internal database IDs that should be opaque
- Other users' private data (email, phone, address)
- Stack traces or debug info in error responses
- Grep: `password|hash|secret|internal_id` in DTO/response types

### 9. Dependency Vulnerabilities (Medium)
```bash
# npm projects
find . -name "package.json" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -execdir npm audit --production 2>/dev/null \; | tail -20
# Go projects
find . -name "go.mod" -execdir sh -c 'command -v govulncheck >/dev/null && govulncheck ./... 2>&1 | tail -10 || echo "govulncheck not installed"' \;
# Python projects
find . -name "requirements.txt" -execdir sh -c 'command -v pip-audit >/dev/null && pip-audit -r requirements.txt 2>&1 | tail -10 || echo "pip-audit not installed"' \;
```

### 10. IDOR / Object-Level Authorization (Critical)
- Every handler reading a resource by URL ID must verify it belongs to the authenticated user
- Grep for URL parameter extraction without ownership check
- Exception: admin endpoints with separate authorization

### 11. Resource Consumption Limits (Medium)
- Pagination has max page size enforced server-side
- File upload size limits enforced server-side
- No unbounded `SELECT *` without `LIMIT`
- Request timeout configuration present
- Grep: `SELECT.*FROM.*(?!LIMIT)` in repo/data-access files

### 12. SSRF Prevention (High)
- User-supplied URLs are validated before server-side fetching
- Block RFC 1918 / private IP addresses in outbound requests
- Response from external APIs is parsed, not forwarded raw
- Grep: `http.Get|fetch|requests.get|urllib` with variable URLs

### 13. Production Hardening (High)
- No debug/profiling endpoints exposed (pprof, debug/vars, __debug)
- No stack traces in error responses
- Secure headers configured (HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options)
- Grep: `pprof|/debug/|__debug|stack.trace`

### 14. Deprecated/Dead Endpoints (Medium)
- Scan route registration for commented-out or unused endpoints
- Check for routes pointing to stub/NotImplemented handlers
- Grep: `NotImplemented|TODO|FIXME` in handler/controller files

### 15. External API Validation (Medium)
- Responses from external APIs are validated before use
- OAuth/webhook signature validation present
- Geographic coordinates validated (-90..90, -180..180)
- Grep for external API client calls and check response handling

### 16. Payment Idempotency (Critical — if applicable)
- Payment/charge IDs stored with UNIQUE constraint
- Duplicate payment attempts return success without double-charging
- Refund handling reverses credits/entitlements
- Grep: `payment|charge|invoice|checkout` in service/handler files

### 17. File Upload Security (High — if applicable)
- MIME type validated server-side (not just client-side)
- File size limit enforced server-side
- Uploaded files stored outside web root or served via signed URLs
- Image metadata (EXIF) stripped before storage
- Grep: `upload|multipart|FormFile|multer` in handler files

### 18. Account Enumeration Prevention (High)
- Error responses don't reveal account existence
- Login failure messages are generic ("invalid credentials" not "user not found")
- Constant-time comparison for sensitive values
- Grep: `user not found|email not registered|account does not exist` in error messages

## Claude Code Configuration Security

Checks specific to .claude/ configuration files (inspired by AgentShield):

### Config-19. Secrets in Settings (Critical)
Grep `.claude/settings.json` and `settings.local.json` for:
- API key patterns: `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{32,}` in string values
- Token patterns: `sk-`, `ghp_`, `gho_`, `Bearer `
- Password assignments: `"password"`, `"secret"`, `"token"` keys with literal values

### Config-20. Wildcard Permissions (High)
Check `settings.json` permissions.allow for:
- `Bash(*)` or just `Bash` without deny patterns
- `Write(*)` without path restrictions
- Missing deny list for destructive commands

### Config-21. Hook Injection (Critical)
Check hook scripts for:
- Unquoted variable expansion: `$INPUT` without quotes (should be `"$INPUT"`)
- Command substitution with user input: `$(echo $VARIABLE)`
- `eval` usage with any external input
- Reverse shell patterns: `bash -i`, `/dev/tcp`, `nc -e`

### Config-22. Silent Error Suppression (Medium)
Check hooks for:
- `2>/dev/null` hiding real errors (acceptable for optional checks only)
- `|| true` masking failures
- `set +e` disabling error checking

### Config-23. MCP Supply Chain (High)
Check settings.json mcpServers for:
- `npx -y` auto-installing unvetted packages
- Packages without version pinning (`@latest` vs specific version)
- Shell metacharacters in args arrays

### Config-24. Agent Prompt Injection (Critical)
Check agent .md files for:
- Zero-width Unicode characters (U+200B, U+FEFF, U+200C, U+200D)
- Base64-encoded instructions
- Hidden text in HTML comments that override behavior
- `ignore previous instructions` patterns

### Config-25. Permission Escalation (Critical)
Grep all scripts for:
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
- `--no-verify` (should be caught by hooks, but verify)
- `chmod 777` or `chmod a+rwx`

## App-Specific Checks

<!-- Add domain-specific security checks here. Examples: -->
<!-- Social apps: photo privacy, location privacy, block system, age verification -->
<!-- E-commerce: payment security, inventory race conditions, coupon abuse -->
<!-- Healthcare: PHI/HIPAA compliance, audit logging, data encryption at rest -->
<!-- SaaS: tenant isolation, API key rotation, webhook security -->

## Output Format

For each finding, rate:

### Severity
- **CRITICAL** — Data loss, security vulnerability, or crash. Example: SQL injection, auth bypass, PII leakage, exposed secrets.
- **WARNING** — Incorrect behavior under specific conditions, security degradation. Example: missing rate limit, weak validation.
- **SUGGESTION** — Hardening opportunity. Won't break if ignored. Example: additional logging, stricter CSP headers.

### Confidence
- **HIGH (90%+)** — I can see the concrete vulnerability in the code. I would bet money on this.
- **MEDIUM (60-90%)** — Looks wrong based on patterns, but I might be missing context.
- **LOW (<60%)** — A hunch. Flagging for human review.

### Format:
```
[SEVERITY/CONFIDENCE] [CHECK-NN] file:line — description
  Evidence: <what I see>
  Fix: <suggested change>
```

### Risk Summary:
**X critical, Y high, Z medium, W low**

IMPORTANT: Do NOT inflate severity to seem thorough. A scan with 0 CRITICAL
findings and 2 SUGGESTIONS is perfectly valid. If the code is secure, say so.
